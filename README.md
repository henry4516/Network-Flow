The Graphs.py well defined graph data structures as well as relevant functions. The implementation preference is edge list.

Main functions are:
find_dipath: find a dipath between two nodes if any. Returns False if none exists.
all_dipaths: find all possible dipaths between two nodes. Returns an empty list if none exists.


Other files are algorithms developed based on definitions in Graphs.py:
SDP: find the shortest dipath between two nodes
ARG: simulation of atomic selfish routing games
