### Data definition file for Graph G=(V,E) and Digraph G=(N,A).

### Data Definitions:
## A Node u is represented by an integer from 1 to n, the max number of nodes, or some other types (strings, etc.).
## A Vertex u is equivalent to Node, but defined in undirected graphs.
## An Arc ij is a Pair of Node, Arc(i, j), where i is tail and j is head
## An Edge ij is equivalent to Arc, but defind in undirected graphs.
## A Path is a sorted list of Edge [v1v2, v2v3, ..., vk-1vk], and no duplicates.
## A Cycle is a Path such that v1 = vk.
## A Dipath is a sorted list of Arc [v1v2, v2v3, ..., vk-1vk], and no dups.
## A Dicycle is a Dipath such that v1 = vk.
## An OrienCycle is oriented cycle such that edges are arcs, in either direction.
## An OrienPath is oriented path such that edges are arcs, in either direction.

## A Tree holds the following properties:
## 1. Connected and has no cycles
## 2. There is a unique path between any two vertices in Tree
## 3. |E| = |N| - 1
## 4. For an oriented Tree, if any node has out-degree of at least 1 then it
##    contains a dicycle.

## In a tree, there exists a unique ij-path for any two vertices i, j.
## Adding an edge to a tree will create a unique cycle, and removing any edge in that cycle will create a tree.
## (Thm 1.3) Let S be a st-cut in the graph. This important thoerm implies that there exists an st-dipath
## if and only if all st-cuts are non-empty.

### ***This constraint applies to all functions below***
### For any input graph/digraph, namely set of vertices/nodes and set of edges/arcs, they are matched (i.e. they can form a valid tree)
### Constraints involving endpoints of all edges/arcs are contained in the set of vertices/nodes.
